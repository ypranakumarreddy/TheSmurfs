       <h5>TThe Smurfs is a 2011 American 3D live-action/computer-animated comedy film loosely based on the comics series of the same name created by the Belgian comics artist Peyo. It was directed by Raja Gosnell and stars Neil Patrick Harris, Jayma Mays, Sof√≠a Vergara, and Hank Azaria, with the voices of Jonathan Winters, Katy Perry, George Lopez, Anton Yelchin, Fred Armisen, and Alan Cumming. It is the first Sony Pictures Animation film with computer animation made with live action, and the first of two live-action/animated Smurfs feature films.[4] The film tells the story of the Smurfs as they get lost in New York, and try to find a way to get back home before Gargamel catches them.

After five years of negotiations, Jordan Kerner bought the rights in 2002, and the film entered development with Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies, until Columbia Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation obtained the film rights in 2008. Filming began in March 2010 in New York City.

After having the release date changed three times, Columbia Pictures released The Smurfs on July 29, 2011. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics, but was a box office success, grossing $564 million worldwide against a $110 million budget, making it the ninth highest-grossing film of 2011, and also making this Sony Pictures Animation's most commercially successful film to-date. A sequel, titled The Smurfs 2, was released on July 31, 2013.</h5>
